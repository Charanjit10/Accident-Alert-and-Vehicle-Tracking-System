Nowadays, road accidents are very high. On time medical aid can help in saving lives. Integrated engineering is a latest trend to solve problems. To
be able to design a product using an integrated technology will be beneficial to any engineering problems and a huge contribution to the community.
An important indicator of survival rates after an accident is the time between the accident and when emergency medical personnel are dispatched to
the accident location. By eliminating the time between when an accident occurs and when the first responders are dispatched to the scene decreases
mortality rate and can save lives. One approach to eliminating the delay between accident occurrence and first responder dispatch is to use in vehicle
automatic accident detection and notification systems. Also tracking a vehicle in case of any theft has become a tough job. This system aims to alert
the near and dear ones of the person in the vehicle about the accident to provide immediate medical aid. In this System when a vehicle meets with an
accident immediately Impact sensor, Piezoelectric Sensor Transducer, Micro electro mechanical system (mems) will detects the signal and sends it to
Arduino (Atmega328P). Immediately microcontroller sends the signal to GPS module to give the exact value of the geographical coordinates which
contains the value of longitude, latitude and altitude. After that the microcontroller sends the alert message through the GSM module to the near and
dear ones. Also in case of any theft our project facilitates the owner to get his vehicleâ€™s position in terms of Latitude and Longitude and a link
directing to the google maps when the owner sends a SMS to the SIM used in the system.
